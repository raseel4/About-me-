Hi, I'm Raseel!

My passion lies in data analysis, and I'm constantly seeking to deepen my understanding of it. Currently, I'm immersed in learning about data science techniques and machine learning algorithms, eager to apply them in practical scenarios. I'm actively seeking collaborations on projects that involve exploring and analyzing large datasets to extract valuable insights. If you're working on such projects or have ideas to share, I'd love to collaborate!
